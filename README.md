# PowerBI-US_POLLUTION_ANALYSIS using PowerBI 

## Introduction
Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
This dataset provides you the pollution in the U.S. It contains daily data for the four major pollutants NO2, O3, SO2 and CO each has 5 specific columns during 2006 and 2010.

## Data Source 
US Pollution  Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis "US_Pollution_2006-2010".

## Abbreviations: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) The four pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2 and O3) each has 5 specific columns. 

State names:  Lists of state names in US

●	State code: Code numbers belongs to each state

●	County code: Unique code numbers specified for county

●	Site number: numbers given to the sites

●	Address: The Address of each locality where pollutant has been detected

●	Country names: List of county names

●	City names: Names of city 

●	Date local: Day Month and the year of every local area when pollutant took place and the hierarchy

●	NO2 units: Units represented by Parts Per Billion, NO2 mean, NO2 1st MAX value, NO2 1st MAX hour, NO2 AQI

●	O3 units: Units represented by parts per million, O3 mean, O3 1st MAX value, O3 1st MAX hour, O3 AQI

●	SO2 units: Units represented by Parts Per Billion, SO2 mean, SO2 1st MAX value, SO2 1st MAX hour, SO2 AQI

●	CO units: Units represented by parts per million, CO2 mean, CO2 1st MAX value, CO2 1st MAX hour, CO2 AQI

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1.Data loading and inspection.

2.Handling missing values.

3.Data cleaning and formatting.

## Visualizations
Text Boxes for 4 Pollutants:

Simple text boxes with bullet points or paragraphs summarizing key information for each pollutant.

Slicers:Use standard slicers for state, city, county, and year selection.

Filled Map:Choropleth map with color gradients indicating pollution severity in different states.

Table of County Names with Codes:Basic table with two columns: County Names and Codes.

Quarter-wise Bifurcation:Stacked bar chart or line chart to show quarter-wise pollution levels for each pollutant.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the U.S. Pollution dataset reveals critical insights into air quality across the nation. Elevated levels of pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) pose environmental and health concerns. The visualizations highlight the top states with the highest pollutant levels, identify peak hours and values, and showcase variations over time. The use of interactive elements, such as slicers and sync slicers, enhances the user experience, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of pollution trends. This report underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and efforts to mitigate air pollution for the well-being of both the population and the environment.
